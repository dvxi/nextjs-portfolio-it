The same conversational analytics platform as in the Conversational Analytics POC (Beauty) was delivered for a post-lease automotive trading client with annual revenue in the tens of millions (USD). Natural-language questions, SQL-backed answers, and optional auto-selected charts; role-based access for operations and sales.

## Scope

- **Self-service analytics:** Non-technical users ask questions in natural language and receive instant answers with charts; reduced dependency on IT and shorter time-to-insight.
- **Architecture:** LangGraph-based pipeline (routing, clarification, SQL generation/execution, analysis); FastAPI backend with async request handling; Next.js chat application; optional PostgreSQL for analytics.
- **Outcome:** Faster time-to-insight and reduced dependency on IT for this client; foundation for scaling users and data sources.

For technical details, architecture, and full stack, see the Conversational Analytics POC (Global Beauty Conglomerate) project.
