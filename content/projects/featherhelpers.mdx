Platformer in Unity where players use a flock of birds to build bridges, walls, and structures to reach the next level. Core feature: bird AI with A* pathfinding so they navigate the level and place elements where the player needs them.

## Gameplay and Tech

- **Unity**: Physics, level design, and flock controls; each bird type has distinct behaviour.
- **A* pathfinding**: Drives bird movement and placement so structures are built in valid, reachable spots.
- **Team**: Design, art, and programming done in a small team; released on itch.io.
