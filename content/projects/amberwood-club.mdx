Early-stage React e-commerce app for custom fragrance kits. Users answer preference questions (season, gender, etc.) and see product shuffling with smooth animations; output is a tailored kit recommendation.

## Features

- Quiz-driven kit builder: preferences drive product selection and ordering.
- Animated product shuffling and transitions for a clear, engaging flow.
- Queue and state handled in the frontend; backend on Node.js.

## Stack

- React, Sass for layout and styling; Node.js for API and server-side logic.
- Responsive layout and clear CTAs for checkout.

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvxi/amberwood-club && cd amberwood-club && npm install && npm start
```
