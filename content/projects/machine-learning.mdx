# Crater Detection for Space Exploration

Proof-of-work from the elective "Machine Learning in Robotics and Edge Devices for Space Exploration": a camera system that runs crater detection on-device to cut network load. Custom object-detection model on Raspberry Pi Pico; React web app for real-time filtered footage.

## Stack

- **ML**: PyTorch, Numpy; training in Google Colab; model pruned for Pico deployment.
- **Edge**: Raspberry Pi Pico, Pico4ML, TinyML; Python script for serial camera data → BMP (Pillow), date/time-based directories.
- **Web**: React, Node.js, Tailwind; fetches and displays filtered images; CORS and refresh tuned for real-time feed without overload.

## Outcome

Only crater-positive frames are stored and sent; bandwidth is reduced for scenarios where uplink is limited. Demonstrates viable edge ML for space-exploration use cases.
