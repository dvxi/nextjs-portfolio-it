## Overview

This project involved the design, development, and ongoing support of my website as a physiotherapist with a master's title. I personally designed and developed the website using the Oxygen Builder for WordPress. Additionally, I provide ongoing support and maintenance services to ensure the website functions smoothly.

## Design and Layout Development

Using the Oxygen Builder, I created a visually appealing and user-friendly design for my fizjotopic website. I carefully analyzed the user journey on physiotherapist webpages to ensure easy navigation and accessibility to relevant information. One of the challenges was organizing numerous certificates and lectures spoken by me, and I made sure to showcase my expertise and qualifications effectively.

## Content Integration

I integrated various content elements into the website, including information about my services, qualifications, certifications, and lectures. I organized the content in a logical manner, making it easy for visitors to find the specific information they are seeking. This ensures a seamless user experience and enhances my credibility as a physiotherapist.

## Customization and Branding

I customized the website to reflect my personal brand as a physiotherapist. I tailored the design elements, color scheme, typography, and visuals to create a cohesive and professional look that aligns with my expertise and qualifications.

## Ongoing Support and Maintenance

I provide ongoing support and maintenance services for the fizjotopic website. This includes regular updates, bug fixes, and content management to keep the website up-to-date and running smoothly. Additionally, I ensure that the certificates and lectures I have spoken are appropriately organized and showcased on the website.

## Result

The fizjotopic website, personally designed and developed by me using the Oxygen Builder, effectively represents my qualifications and expertise as a physiotherapist. The user-friendly design, organized content, and ongoing support contribute to a positive user experience and help me showcase my skills and certifications. The website serves as a valuable tool for attracting new clients and establishing my professional online presence.
