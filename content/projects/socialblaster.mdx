## Design

The website was designed in Figma. I implemented the design in Oxygen Builder, which allowed me to create a fully responsive website in a short time. I also created a logo and visual identity for the group in cooperation with our proffesional graphic designer.

## Student research group

I am a co-founder of the Social Blaster student research group at AGH University of Science and Technology. The group was created to help students gain practical experience in the field of marketing and web development. We work with real clients and create marketing strategies for them. We also conduct research on the effectiveness of various marketing activities. We have already worked with several clients, including a large companies from the graphic or stone industry.
