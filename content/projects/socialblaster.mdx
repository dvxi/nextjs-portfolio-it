Website and visual identity for Social Blaster, a marketing student research group at AGH. Target audience: young students; design and branding tuned for that demographic (vibrant colours, modern typography, clear navigation). As co-founder, I also ran weekly meetings (marketing, SEO, guest speakers); the site promotes sessions, topics, and guests.
