## Design

When designing new sections, I make sure to achieve consistency with the rest of the site. I also conduct UX research to better understand the typical user journey of a person interested in the services of a personal trainer.

## Client care

When making fundamental changes to the structure of the site, we perform A/B testing and I continuously monitor Google Analytics. This allows us to position the client more effectively against the competition and also builds trust in us as an agency.
