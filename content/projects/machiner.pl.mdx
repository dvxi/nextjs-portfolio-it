Custom WordPress site for a construction machinery company. Solo development from the client’s Figma UI; the design had no mobile version, so I proposed, designed, and implemented a responsive mobile layout in close consultation with the client. Future roadmap: React integration and Google Maps Distance Matrix API for distances and travel times.

## Scope

- **WordPress + Oxygen**: Custom theme from Figma; flexible layout and content management.
- **Mobile**: Responsive design and build; tested across devices and iterated with client feedback.
- **Planned**: React for richer interactivity; Distance Matrix API for logistics-style features.
